Week #1

For the first week, the topic for the debate was the system architecture. 
What could be the ideal design for the system and what modules we would include in the design?

Also, the use of Heroku and AWS was a part of discussion.

For the next week #2, I plan to work on constrcuting the architecture and creating the database schemas. Also I will have a task of creating the Rest API for the web-app. 

In the architecture design, we have to build the server nodes and the REST api services for the Heroku web-app. The rest api can either rest in Heroku or on AWS. Either of the approach will decide the amount of hours to be invested in the procedure.

I had a task on hand to research about the most suitable databses for storing sessions, shopping cart, product catalogs.
For the user accounts, I think we will use Reddis for storing sessions of the logged-in users. As reddis is a key-value database and crazy fast for Master-slave design, it will be a good fit for the user`s session management.

For managing the shopping cart and product catalog, we can use Riak. Apart from highly reliable and scalable database, Riak also provides fault tolerance if a server node goes down. In case, we scale the business and add more number of nodes into the network, Riak provides much more scalibility.
Morever, Riak is a persistance database so we can store the user selected cart choices even after he goes down and comes back again.
