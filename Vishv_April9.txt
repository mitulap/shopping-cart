Week#1

I was working on the understanding Nodejs app  structure, i.e. async callbacks . In addition I had set up a basic REST API(GET and POST API) code using ExpressJs.
Also I worked on deciding use of Heroku and AWS in the system architecture, i.e., we decided to proceed with following points :
1) Set up REST API on Heroku and database cluster on AWS node.
2) Create REST APIs in NodeJS and perform database operation through REST API on AWS.
3) REST API will first hit load balancer and then it will redirect to appropriate node.

In addition, we worked on setting up a simple NodeJs app on Heroku. We also tried setting up auto scaling factor with Heroku and configuring start up commands for NodeJS App.

For this week, team's main discussion was deciding system architecture. Along with the other team members, I was involved in finding a suitable database for user's session data storage. As per our research, Redis is best solution, as its latency is very less and we can respond to the user request very fast.

For Week2, I am planning to set up REST API with database, i.e. attach CRUD operations with database. And also use the integrate REST API with front of Web App.
