These were some of the ideas that I have thought of that we could implement as the additional features.
1)	To display no items in the bag as a separate page if the bag has no items and is empty.
2)	To have a ‘forgot password’ page and implementing this would help the users and we would have a plus point for our shopping cart.
3)	To display the ‘User Information’ this includes the number of users accessing one particular product, the total number of users who are logged in currently or at any particular time. 
4)	To display the ‘Product Information’ which includes displaying the product which is trending now-a-days or the one sold out the most on a particular day, week, month and year. Increase the rate of a product automatically if it is being sold extensively during particular time period.
